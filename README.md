# Hello-World-

This is a Vite Exercise for the Springboard Software Engineering Career Course. I chose to add a sunflower pic because they are my favorite flower.

I downloaded the pic from Unsplash, but I had to create multiple sunflower files because the original size was too large.  I played with sizing until the sunflower could be seen in the window.
I also wanted to practice attributing someone's work.  The photographer name and unsplash account is at the bottom.  I also had to play with the layout because the original display had all the words
mashed together with no spacing.
